I have compiled a list of ideas you can use to brainstorm your adventures.

# Heroes'/Antagonist's Goals
Stories are fundamentally about problem solving. The problems usually come from the mix of two sources:

1. The Heroes strive to achieve a goal, and struggle to overcome challenges and obstacles on their path (often created by the Villain).
2. Villain wants something, and players are trying to disrupt their evil plan.

Whatever goal the Heroes have - the Villain will have the opposite one (and vice versa). You can start from the either side. Give the goal to the Players ("Obtain a valuable item"), and the Villain will want the opposite ("Obtain the item first"). Give the goal to the Villain ("Perform an Evil Ritual") and the players will want the opposite ("Stop the Evil Ritual"). The only difference is the motivation, Heroes want things for noble reasons, Villains want them for evil ones. If you'll be using the goal for the villain - just put an evil spin on it.

List of goals you can use for either Heroes or Villains:

- **Obtain McGuffin/Information.**

> Players and antagonist compete for the same item (be the first to the pirate treasure.)  
> Players are trying to prevent antagonist from getting an item (Prevent a villain from getting a powerful dark artifact.)  
> Get the pirate treasure, the lost crystal of Atlantis, your stolen belongings.  
> Obtain a treasure map, secret codes, powerful spell, find Villain's only weakness.

- **Win a competition / prevent the other side from winning.**

> Win the race around the world.  Win a mock-war between adventuring parties.  Win a Quidditch game.

- **Seize power.**

> Evil Vizier wants to replace the king and players need to prevent that.   
> Evil King is in charge and players need to overthrow him.   
> The King has died and both sides want to be the next King.

- **Kill a Person.**

> Heroes: Kill the villain, a vampire/werewolf/basilisk, all the baddies in the area. Stop a serial killer.   
> Villain: Kill the heroes, kill people to drink their blood or to satisfy violent urges.  

- **Kill a Creature.**

> Heroes: Kill a monster.   
> Villain: Kill an innocent creature.

- **Destroy an Item.**

> Destroy a doomsday device, the ring of power, a piece of blackmail.

# Creating multiple unique adventures from the same goal
Here's the list of ways to create dozens of unique adventure ideas based on the same goal:

- **Switch players/antagonist sides.**

> Players try to get away with a crime instead of investigating it.

- **Reverse the goal.**

> Smuggle/Plant an item instead of stealing it.  
> Close the portal instead of opening it.  
> Banish the creature instead of summoning it.  

- **Use a different target - person, creature, item, information, location/base.**

> Destroy an item instead of killing a person.  
> Abduct a person instead of stealing the treasure.  
> Protect a secret instead of the location.  
> Chase a lost pet instead of the criminal.  

- **Change "do it for yourself" to "help other people".**

> Don't get murdered - prevent a murder.  
> Steal an item - create a distraction while someone else steals it.  
> Get away with the crime - help someone else to get away with the crime.

- **Add restrictions/complications.**

> Make it stealthy (commit a heist instead of robbery).  
> Avoid violence (capture a person alive instead of killing them).  
> Achieve the goal by social means (ruin the person's reputation instead of killing them).  
> Do it before the rivals do it first.  
> See the [list of complications](https://playmirage.io/prompts/complications) for more ideas.

- **Combine multiple goals.**

> Deliver an item while on the run from the law.  
> Sabotage a ritual to rescue a person.  
> Infiltrate a group to steal an item.  
> Solve a mystery to be able to find a lost person.

- **Add different subgoals, put different challenges/obstacles in the way.**

> Get through the dangerous location instead of an elaborate security system.  
> Obtain information about the villain's weakness instead of the only weapon that can kill them.  
> Convince a witness to talk instead of following the trail of footsteps.  
> The object is difficult to deliver because it's being hunted by bandits, or because the terrain is dangerous and inhospitable, or because it's large and fragile, or because it's a criminal trying to escape, or because it's cattle you need to keep alive, or because it's a bratty princess who doesn't want to go to school.  
> See the [List of Challenges](https://playmirage.io/prompts/challenges) and [List of Villain's Moves](https://playmirage.io/prompts/villain-moves) for more ideas.

- **Use different concrete details - High Concept Premise, Settings, NPCs, McGuffins, etc.**

> Steal the Elixir of Youth from the unicorn instead of stealing the Aztec gold from the Spanish Galleon.   
> Steal an item from a dream instead of casino.  
> Escort a dragon instead of a prisoner.  
> Escape from Jurassic Park instead of the prison.  
> Fight a self righteous paladin instead of the bandit gang leader.   


- **Use different motivations.**

> Kill a person out of revenge instead of for money.  
> Resurrect your loved one instead of summoning a demon.  
> Compete for the heart of the lady instead of the treasure.

# High Concept Premises
"High Concept" ideas are creative premises, interesting "What if?" scenarios. They will put your players into fantastical and unusual situations. You can use them as a starting point for your adventure - pick a High Concept idea, and see which interesting problems/goals it can generate, or just combine it with one of the goals from the list above.

- Being shrunk to a tiny size, maybe put into a person's/creature's body. (Honey I shrunk the Kids, Ant Man, Anatomy Park).
- Switching bodies (Freaky Friday).

- Adventure taking place in a dream, illusion, virtual reality, computer game, a TV show (Inception, Ready Player One, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Matrix, Jumanji).
- Deal with the Devil.
- Animals/creatures gain sentience/intelligence.
- Open portal to another world, a parallel dimension, an alternate timeline (Mist, Stargate, Another Earth).

- Magic is fading / going wild and unpredictable.
- Space ship crashing in middle ages.
- Magic items (or maybe just some magic items) become secretly sentient and drive around their owners while they are asleep.
- An ancient evil is very slowly rising out of the ground and waking up. People need to hurry to figure out how to make it go away or else assemble a team strong enough to kill it when it awakes.

Tyranny of the traditionally good creatures like celestials, paladins, etc. The slightest misstep can cause a person to be 'disappeared'.

Use the [Adventure Writing Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R7bOixB-1tN7U3lEi47L-NDA91CibDJ0VTgrbKO2nlQ/) to help you develop these goals into a complete adventure.

See the [List of Challenges](https://playmirage.io/prompts/challenges), [List of Complications](https://playmirage.io/prompts/complications), and [List of Villain's Moves](https://playmirage.io/prompts/villain-moves) for more ideas on what challenges/obstacles the players will need to overcome on their path to the goal.  

See the list of fun [Fantasy Settings](https://playmirage.io/world) I have collected.

For interesting ideas for a Villain:

 - Take the personality from a TV/Movie character that you like, but make them evil. Adapt them to fantasy (Evil Steampunk Iron Man). Combine the traits from several characters (Legolas with the personality of Spider Man, John Snow with the personality of Jack Sparrow), or reverse their gender or a key personality trait (female Dr. Octavius, cheerful Batman).
 - For their appearance - find an illustration on ArtStation, Pinterest, or /r/ImaginaryCharacters. If the appearance is very different from the movie character you have based their personality on - even better.

I have created the "[Adventure Prompts Tool](https://playmirage.io/prompts)" that will pick the random Goals, High Concepts, Complications, Settings, and Challenges for you.
