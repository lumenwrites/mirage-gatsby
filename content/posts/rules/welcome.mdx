# Welcome to Mirage!

Mirage is a lighthearted, social, easy to learn and play game, focused on roleplay, storytelling, improvisation, imagination and creativity. Your goal is to make up and play out a fun story. You will go on adventures, complete quests, find treasure, slay dragons, and gain awesome powers.

Have you heard about DnD? Mirage is made for the people who (like me) enjoy the social/creative aspects of DnD, but don't like the countless arguments over the intricate rules, the slow ordeal of combat encounters, and all the tedious arithmetics.

The rules of Mirage very simple, yet flexible, powerful and fun. They're designed to encourage imagination, creativity, and storytelling, and then fade into the background and stay out of the way of roleplaying.

You will learn everything you need to play by reading only two pages (this one and the [rules](/rules)).

Mirage can be played online and in-person, but I'm currently focusing on the online version (over [Discord](https://discord.gg/zt4N23d)).

## How to Play
One of the players will be a **Game Master (GM)** - he is the narrator of your story, he creates the world around you and plays the part of all the non-player characters **(NPCs)**.

The other players are characters in this make-believe world. The GM will describe where these characters are and what is happening around them, and the players will play out scenes in these situations.

You will pretend to be your character. You describe what they say and do, react the way they would react, playing their role like an actor.

You will tell the GM what you want to do. It can be anything you can imagine - talk to other characters, attack an enemy, buy an item, cast a spell, etc. Then the GM will use the rules of the game and his imagination to tell you the result of your actions.

You will talk to the NPCs, and find an adventure to go on. As you adventure, your character will grow more powerful by acquiring mighty weapons and magical artifacts, and gaining experience. You will spend your experience points to learn amazing spells and abilities. You can also spend them to increase your Health and Energy reserves, increase the amount of spells and abilities you are able to learn, and increase the number of items you can carry in your inventory. You will creatively use the newly gained powers to overcome challenges, defeat the enemies, and complete quests. If youâ€™re smart and inventive, you will return home victorious and with a great story to tell.

## Getting Started

To start playing, you need 3 things:

1. Basic understanding of the [rules](/rules) (don't worry if something remains unclear, you'll pick it up as you play, players and GMs are very helpful).
2. A character sheet (how to create a character is explained in the rules).
3. Other people to play with - [use our Discord community](https://discord.gg/zt4N23d) to find a game you can join  (we play over the voice chat or play-by-post).

## Questions and Feedback

This system is still in active development, basically it's a draft.

If you have any questions or ideas on how to improve it - you can send me an email to `lumen@playmirage.io`, or message me over discord(`lumen#7925`).
