# Roleplaying  Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to get the most out of our games. If you’re new - don’t get too overwhelmed by all these tips. Practice them one at a time - pick one principle you’d like to get better at, and focus on that one thing for the duration of the game. When GMing, try to encourage players to follow these principles.

<div className="columns">

### Play to find out what happens
Do things that result in a good story, optimize for fun instead of “winning”.

### Yes, and
Treat the ideas suggested by other players as awesome (even when they may seem silly). Don’t shut down people’s ideas - embrace them, help them succeed. Adopt ideas, build on top of them, add something new, find a way to make them work, make them better. Help other players be awesome. Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for other characters to shine.

### Share the Spotlight
Try to make sure that all players have enough opportunities to participate in the story. Avoid talking over other players and dominating the conversation, but don’t be afraid to speak up when you have something fun to contribute. Help quiet/shy players - ask their opinion or what they would like to do next. If you notice someone being interrupted - ask them what they were about to say.

### Contribute to the story
Don’t be afraid to add information to the story. Help the GM to establish the scene, point out interesting details in the world around you. Answer unsolved questions, come up with explanations for things that seems inconsistent, fill in the gaps, help to create a story that makes sense.

### Advance the Plot
Help the GM to move the story along. If you notice that players are stuck talking to each other and going nowhere - make a decision, conclude this scene, and move on to the next one.

### Be an active player
Don’t wait for others to entertain you, assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others, try to actively contribute ideas to the story, enhance everyone’s experience. Positive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome.

### Stay in character
Try to immerse yourself in playing your character, like an actor. Try playing characters with real feelings and believable motivations. Try to make other people love and care about your character. Think about your character’s distinctive features, quirks, unique speech patterns. Don’t be shy to act it out, do a silly voice.

### Develop your Character
What are their values and ideals? What do they fear? What flaws/weaknesses do they need to overcome? What is their backstory, significant events that shaped them? What is their deep dark secret? Do they have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What’s going through their head at this moment?

### Goals and Motivations
Figure out what your character wants, form your own goals, pursue them, creatively overcome obstacles on your way. What does your character want from life? What is their current goal? What do they want from this quest?

### Explore the Relationships
How does your character feel about the other party members? Establish a connection. How do you know each other? What do you think about them?

Create interesting tension, conflict dynamics between the characters in the party (while still collaborating as players). What does your character need from another PC? Why do they refuse to give it to you? Could your goals be at odds with each other? As the story goes on, how can your characters resolve the conflict?

### Allow yourself to feel
This game can get really amazing when you allow yourself to really feel what your character feels in the moment. Being excited, scared, even crying. When you feel safe to express emotions around your friends, and really care about your character and theirs, you will have some amazing and unforgettable moments.

### Relax and have fun
If you’re feeling stuck and having trouble coming up with ideas - just do whatever seems to make sense at the moment. Often an idea that seems simple and obvious to you will lead to something interesting. Remember, as long as you and others are enjoying the game - you’re doing great! 

### Make Friends
Get to know people outside the games. Leave some time for a bit of socializing before or after the games, chat between the games in the text channel.

<!-- ### Think out of the box
Look for unexpected ideas and creative choices. Look for non-combat resolutions. See if there’s a way to sneak past the enemy or talk your way out of a sticky situation.

### Do the obvious thing
This game is meant to encourage you to be inventive, creative, goofy. But if you're feeling stuck, if you have trouble coming up with something crazy or awesome - just do the simple, obvious thing, move the story along. Nothing is wrong with that. Besides, what seems obvious to you can be new and exciting to other players. -->

# Code of Conduct

Follow the code of conduct to avoid the most common roleplaying problems and be the kind of person people like playing with.

<div className="columns">

### Be good to other players
Be nice, treat other players with respect. Make sure everyone feels comfortable, welcome, and enjoys the game.

### Show up on time
Don't be late, make sure to notify everyone in advance if you're going to miss the session.

### Avoid sensitive subjects
Unless you're reasonably sure that everyone is on board with this, try to keep things PG-13 and avoid bringing up subjects that make people uncomfortable (excessive violence, sex, real-world politics, religion, etc).

### Don't tell people what to do
Play your character, don't tell others how to play theirs. It often doesn't feel great, even if you have a good point. Suggesting ideas and arguing about the next course of action is fine, just make sure your advice isn't unwelcome. 

### Ask for consent
Don't attack other player's characters, steal their stuff, or force them to do anything against their will without asking first if it's okay. 

### Evil/Chaotic/Crazy characters
It can be annoying to play with characters who keep killing everybody, constantly run off to do their own thing, keep undermining the party's goals, or regularly must be bailed out of trouble. If you're playing an evil character - be evil to NPCs, but find ways to get along with  your party members.


<div className="column-break"/>


### Stay invested, pay attention
Listen to what other players and the GM are saying, pay attention to the story, don't get distracted and browse social media, don't check out when it's someone else's turn.

### Avoid meta-gaming
Sometimes you as a player will know things your character doesn't. For example, if the GM describes things to other characters when your character isn't in the scene. Avoid using this information to make decisions your character otherwise wouldn't make.

### Vote
If your group gets stuck in an argument, unable to decide on the next course of action - just call for a vote (or flip a coin), and move on. It's better to go with a random plan than to be stuck arguing. Unless you have a very important in-character reason to disagree, use this as an opportunity to practice yes-and'ing.

### Learn the rules
Know how the game works, and what powers your character has.

<!-- ### Resolve conflict
Resolve conflict by having a conversation outside of the game. If someone keeps doing something that makes you upset or uncomfortable - have an open, honest conversation with them after the game. -->

### Be nice to the GM
Don't argue with the GM, accept their decisions - protracted arguments only slow down the game. Give them feedback. If you dislike something GM does - tell them after the game. If you really like something they do - make sure to let them know as well.
