### Put Players in Interesting Situations
Think of the game as a string of short-form improv scenes, one leading into the next. Establish the tasks players need to accomplish, set up the scene (describe the setting and the NPCs nearby), and place obstacles into their path to drive the action. Set the stage and let the players play in it. 

### Create Consequences
Imagine how the world responds to the players’ actions. Reward the players for their victories, but introduce setbacks and complications. Acting to solve one problem may lead to unexpected consequences, creating further goals or problems that drive the story forward and create new situations.

### Watch the Story Unfold
Raise the stakes, escalate the challenges. Things go from good to bad to worst, before they’re resolved.

Cycle tense action with relatively peaceful situations creating opportunities for trading, training, roleplay.

Cycle between the 3 core elements of the game - Exploration, Social Interaction, and Combat.

### Encourage Players to Roleplay
Ask players to vividly describe how they’re using their abilities, ask them to name an interesting detail their character has noticed about this location or a monster. Create more social challenges that can only be solved through roleplay.

Ask quieter players if they’d like to answer before more outgoing players will take the scene.

### Ending the Session
If you end the session in the middle of a quest - try to end on a cliffhanger, something for players to look forward to.

After they complete their quest - show how the world has changed after the final battle, tie up the loose plot threads. Give out the rewards.

Talk to the players about the session, ask about what they liked, mention your favorite roleplay moments.
