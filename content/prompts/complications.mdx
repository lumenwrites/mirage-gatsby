# Complications
<span className="small">(see more prompts in <Link to="/prompts">Prompts App</Link>)</span>

Here's the list of complications players can encounter on their adventures:

1. Do it under time pressure (before the ritual is complete, before people run out of air, before reinforcements arrive, before or during the event, in transit, while you still have the chance).
2. Do it while competing with the rival team.
3. Unrelated people are interfering with the objective.
4. Do it stealthily (don't attract attention, don't leave clues, no witnesses).
5. Do it while pretending to be someone else.
6. Do it without revealing that your client is involved.
7. Prevent collateral damage, protect the innocents who are around.
8. Avoid violence. Defeat/capture the villain/creature without it being harmed.
9. Mitigate the risk, there's a high probability of causing a lot of damage if you're not careful.
10. Two challenges conflict with each other (you must break your stealth to help someone in trouble, capture criminal or save people who are currently in danger). 
11. Difficult choice. Choose lesser of two evils, choose which people to rescue. Requiring personal sacrifice, risk, compromise. 
12. Opportunities that come with a difficulty, cost or have negative consequences.
13. Resolve moral dilemma (the creature is dangerous but doesn't deserve to die, you're working for a bad guy, both sides of the conflict have valid points, completing a quest will harm people/environment).
14. Do it with incomplete information.
15. Do it with limited resources or without preparation.
16. Do it without access to powers you're used to having (while sick/injured/debilitated, in an area where magic is outlawed/disabled, having lost your equipment).

18. You can't trust anyone.
19. Doing it is illegal, or against authorities best interests, or is threatening a powerful group. 
20. There are regulations/restrictions on what you can do hindering your progress.
21. Do it while being supervised (the media is all over you, a brilliant detective is on your tail, you are under suspicion, the enemy knows you're coming, you have a spy/mole).
22. Do it despite your flaws/temptations/fears.
23. It causes conflict/infighting within the team (player characters will have opposite goals/reactions to it).
24. Do it while working together with antagonist or someone else you don't like. 
25. The side you're working for turns out to be evil.
26. The villain is someone you know/like/respect.
27. The villain is a respected public figure, celebrity, is liked by people or has authority over you.
