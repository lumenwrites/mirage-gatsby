# Rules for Players

To get ready for the game, you need 3 things:

1. **Basic understanding of the rules**  
Read this page. Don't worry if you don't get everything right away, you'll easily pick things up as you play, other players and GM will help you out.
2. **Filled in character sheet**  
Read the character creation rules below.
3. **Other people to play with**  
Go to our [discord community](https://discord.gg/zt4N23d) and find a game you can join  (we play over the voice chat or play-by-post).

<div className="columns">

### Health
Your initial max health is 10 hit-points. You lose points when you get hurt. Recover points by drinking a potion, using a spell, or taking a rest.

**Short rest** (1 hour in a safe environment) recovers 4 points.

**Long rest** (8 hours in a safe environment) restores you to full health.

### Energy Points (EP)
Your initial max energy is 10 points. Spend them to cast spells and use abilities.

Recover them by drinking a potion or taking a rest (same as health).

### Indulging
You can also recover them when you indulge in your character's flaw or succumb to their weakness in a way that makes you vulnerable, introduces a complication, sacrifices your relationships, or otherwise puts you at a risk/disadvantage. For example: get angry, act reckless, get caught lying, forget something important, surrender, run away, act lazy, get high at the worst possible moment, trigger the memory of a past trauma, antagonize an NPC, threaten someone too powerful, etc. Depending on the severity of the complication it causes, GM will award you  1-10 EP.


### Experience (XP)
Spend points to learn spells and abilities. To learn a spell or an ability, spend the amount of points equal to it's level (learning a 3rd Level Ability costs 3 Experience points).

Spend 2 points to increase your max Health or Energy by 1 point.

Gain XP as a reward for overcoming challenges, completing quests, and awesome roleplay moments.

### Abilities
These are extraordinary abilities or specific skills your character has. For example, being very strong, knowing how to pick locks, or being great at seduction.


Without the ability, your character is as good at doing things as an average person. You can assume that you will succeed if you try to do something that any regular person is capable of. But if you want to attempt doing something really difficult or risky, the GM can say that it would require a relevant ability (you would need a   “Strongman” ability to lift a super heavy rock, “a Diplomat” to talk the king out of starting a war).

### Inventory
You can carry and use up to 10 Items. Mundane and tiny items don’t count (a note, a pen, regular clothes). Ammo doesn’t count.

During the short rest, you can unequip items and stash them somewhere (at your house, on a horse, etc). Stashed items can’t be used until re-equipped.

### Trading
There’s no gold. There’s no need to micromanage paying for meals, a simple room in an inn, or buying mundane items (arrows, ink) - they cost nothing. For the powerful and valuable items, you trade.

You can trade items in your inventory with friendly NPCs and other players. Items don’t have a predetermined price. It all depends on how much the NPC likes you, and how much they want what you have to offer in exchange. Negotiate and bargain to get a better deal.

Give a valuable item to an NPC in exchange for teaching you a skill. Or offer to do some work for them.

### Combat
In combat, the GM will tell you when it's your turn to act. During your turn, your character can move around and do one thing (for example, cast a spell). If you have something that can help you evade the damage (a shield, a spell, a  dodge skill), you can use it when you're attacked. 

If you run out of Health, you pass out. If someone hits you when you’re passed out - you die and turn into a ghost. You can haunt your fellow players until they find a resurrection scroll, or make a new character.

## Creating your Character

To create your character you will need to fill in your <Link to="/character-sheet">character sheet</Link>. It will contain your character’s stats, abilities, spells, inventory, and the description of your character - everything you need for roleplaying.

### Using a premade character sheet (for novice players)
Novice players are highly encouraged to use one of the premade character sheets. Hover over the "Create" button and pick a premade character sheet you think will fit you best. Then all you need is to come up with your character idea (name, appearance, personality, etc), and fill in your character description.

If you’re not sure what kind of character to create - use your favorite character from a book or a movie. If you want to make it more original - combine the traits from several characters (Legolas with the personality of Spider Man, John Snow with the personality of Jack Sparrow), or reverse their gender or a key personality trait (female Tony Stark, evil Hermione, cheerful Batman). If you're still feeling stuck - just play as yourself but with magic powers.

### Custom Character Creation for long-term Campaigns
Players more familiar with their favorite spells and items can create a custom character. Create a blank character sheet and add:

- Up to 2 first level abilities.
- Up to 2 first level spells.
- Up to 2 first level magic items.
- Up to 2 first level equipment items.

Then fill in appearance/presonality/ambitions/backstory, and you're ready to play.


### Custom Character Creation for One-Shots
Because in one-shot games there isn't as much time to level up and develop your character, characters start at a higher level.

You start at level 5. Create a blank character sheet and add:

- Up to 3 abilities, 5th level or lower.
- Up to 3 spells, 5th level or lower.
- Up to 3 magic items, 5th level or lower.
- Up to 3 equipment items, 5th level or lower.
- If you really want a higher level item, or an item that doesn't exist in a game - talk to the GM ask if they would be okay with that.

Your character maintains their progress between separate one-shot games.

## Rolling Dice

When you attempt to do something difficult or risky, the GM will tell you to roll the dice (d20). The number you roll will determine the result of your action:

- **20** - **Triumph**  
You get what you want in an exceptionally spectacular way. If you’re dealing damage, double it.
- **15-19** - **Success**  
You successfully perform the action you were attempting.
- **7-14** - **Success at a cost**  
Your succeed, but suffer some negative consequence, complication, or a setback.
- **2-6** - **Failure**  
Your fail, and suffer some negative consequence, complication, or a setback.
- **1** - **Disaster**  
You dramatically fail and suffer a severe setback. You might lose equipment, take damage from an enemy counterattack, or face some other misfortune.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes the GM will tell you to roll several (2, 3, or 4) dice with "**Advantage**" or "**Disadvantage**". If you have Advantage - use the **highest** one of the rolls and ignore the rest. If you have disadvantage - use the **lowest** roll. For example, if GM tells you "Roll 3 Dice with Advantage", and you roll 4,17, and 9, your result is 17.

### You can improve your chances by using abilities
When you have an ability relevant to the task you are attempting ("Strogman" for lifting something heavy, "Deception" for lying, etc), you can use it to add advantage dice to your roll, or remove disadvantage dice.

For example, Super-Strongman ability allows you to improve your roll by 3 dice:

- If you were supposed to roll 1 dice, by using Super-Strongman you can roll 4 dice with advantage.
- If you were facing a difficult task and were supposed to roll 3 dice with disadvantage, with Super-Strongman you would roll 2 dice with advantage (remove 2 disadvantage dice and add 1 advantage die).
