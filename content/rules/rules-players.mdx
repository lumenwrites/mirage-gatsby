# Character Sheet

All you need to know about your character is stored on your <Link to="/character-sheet">character sheet</Link>.

<div className="columns">

### Stats and Powers
Your character has 3 stats - **Health**, **Energy**, and **Experience**. You also have 4 kinds of "powers" - **Abilities**, **Spells**, **Magic Items**, and **Equipment**. Your character grows stronger when you increase the stats and gain new powers.

### Health Points (HP)
You lose Health Points when you get hurt. Recover points by drinking a potion, using a spell, or taking a rest.
- **Short rest** (1 hour in a safe environment) recovers 5 points.
- **Long rest** (8 hours in a safe environment) restores you to full health.

<div className="column-break"/>

### Energy Points (EP)
Spend them to cast spells and use abilities.

Recover them by drinking a potion or taking a rest (same as health).

### Experience (XP)
Spend Experience Points to learn Spells and Abilities.

Spend 2 points to increase your max Health or Energy by 1 point.

Gain XP as a reward for overcoming challenges, completing quests, teamwork, and awesome roleplay moments.

# Powers

<div className="columns">

### Abilities
You use abilities to do things that are difficult or require expertise. For example, lifting heavy things, picking locks, sneaking, climbing, investigating, seducing, lying. Without the relevant ability, your character is as good at doing things as an average person.

There's no dice. You can assume that you will succeed if you try to do something that any regular person is capable of. But if you want to attempt doing something really difficult or risky, the GM can say that it would require a relevant ability (you would need an “Athletics” ability to lift a super heavy rock, “Diplomacy” to talk the king out of starting a war).

Example of an ability:

<Power power={exampleAbility} sample />

Using this ability costs **2** Energy points. To learn it, you need to spend **3** Experience points, and you must have **Adept** skill level in **Survival** school.

<div className="column-break"/>

### Schools and Spells
Abilities and Spells are organized into Schools (like Warfare, Stealth, Charm, Necromancy) and Skill Levels  (Novice, Initiate, Adept, Expert, Master).

You can learn "Novice" level powers right away. To progress to the more advanced level in the school, you need to learn at least one power from the previous level. So if you want to be able to learn Adept-level Illusionism spells, you need to know one Initiate-level Illusionism spells.

<Power power={exampleSpell} sample />

This spell costs **4** Energy Points to cast, **5** Experience Points to learn, and requires **Expert** level skills in **Illusionism** school.

</div>

# Items

<div className="columns">

### Magic Items and Equipment
Items are classified based on how rare, valuable, and powerful they are (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Supreme). Example item:

<Power power={exampleItem} sample />

This is a **rare** item, it deals **6** damage.

### Inventory
You can carry and use up to 10 Items. Mundane and tiny items don’t count (a note, a pen, regular clothes). Ammo doesn’t count.

During the short rest, you can unequip items and stash them somewhere (at your house, on a horse, etc). Stashed items can’t be used until re-equipped.

<div className="column-break"/>

### Trading
There’s no currency. There’s no need to micromanage paying for meals, a simple room in an inn, or buying mundane items (arrows, ink) - they cost nothing. For the powerful and valuable items, you trade.

You can trade items in your inventory with friendly NPCs and other players. Items don’t have a predetermined price. More powerful/rare items tend to be more valuable, but it all depends on how much the NPC likes you, and how much they want what you have to offer in exchange (a waterskin might be priceless in the desert).

Negotiate and bargain to get a better deal.

# Action Scenes

<div className="columns">

### Combat
During action scenes (usually combat), the GM will tell you when it's your turn to act. During your turn, your character can **move** and take **one action** (attack, cast a spell, drink a potion, etc).

If you have something that can help you evade the damage (a shield, a spell, a  dodge skill), you can use it when you're attacked.

All attacks hit automatically unless there's a reason they don't (such as enemy using a shield spell). Weapons and spells deal the damage written on their card.

<div className="column-break"/>

### Distances

There are two distances. When something is **In Reach**, it means you can use it, reach it with a melee weapon, or cast a spell that requires touch. When something is **In Range** - you can hit it with a ranged weapon or a spell, or run up to it during your turn.

### Death
If you run out of Health, you pass out. If someone hits you when you’re passed out - you die. and turn into a ghost. You can haunt your fellow players until they find a resurrection scroll, or make a new character.

## Creating your Character

To create your character you will need to fill in your <Link to="/character-sheet">character sheet</Link>. It will contain your character’s stats, abilities, spells, inventory, and the description of your character - everything you need for roleplaying.

### Using a premade character sheet (for novice players)
Novice players are highly encouraged to use one of the premade character sheets. Hover over the "Create" button and pick a premade character sheet you think will fit you best. Then all you need is to come up with your character idea (name, appearance, personality, etc), and fill in your character description.

If you’re not sure what kind of character to create - use your favorite character from a book or a movie. If you want to make it more original - combine the traits from several characters (Legolas with the personality of Spider Man, John Snow with the personality of Jack Sparrow), or reverse their gender or a key personality trait (female Tony Stark, evil Hermione, cheerful Batman). If you're still feeling stuck - just play as yourself but with magic powers.

### Custom Character Creation
Players more familiar with their favorite spells and items can create a custom character.

You start with 12 Max Health, 12 Max Energy, and 12 Experience.

Create a blank character sheet and:

- Spend your Experience to learn Abilities and Spells.
- Select up to 2 common magic items.
- Select up to 2 common equipment items.

Then fill in appearance/presonality/ambitions/backstory, and you're ready to play.

<!--
- Select up to 2 novice-level abilities.
- Select up to 2 novice-level spells.
-->
