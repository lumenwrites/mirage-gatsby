# Mirage Rules

To get ready for the game, you need 3 things:

1. **Basic understanding of the rules**

2. **Filled in character sheet**  
Read the character creation rules below.
3. **Other people to play with**  
Go to our [discord community](https://discord.gg/zt4N23d) and find a game you can join.

## Character Sheet

All you need to know about your character is stored on your <Link to="/character-sheet">character sheet</Link>.

<div className="columns">


### Talents
Things your character is particularly good at. Without the relevant talent your character is as good at doing things as an average person. 

<Power power={exampleTalent} sample />

Using a talent gives you advantage on the dice roll (see the dice rules below).

### Abilities
Extraordinary abilities, cool things you can do. **Spells** you can cast and the non-magical **Skills** you can use. 

<Power power={exampleSpell} sample />

### Inventory
Your magic items, potions, weapons, and other equipment. 

<Power power={exampleItem} sample />

You don’t need to keep track of mundane items (food, regular clothes, ammo, etc.) or money, assume that your character has the items it makes sense for them to have (an archer would have arrows, a thief would have lock-picks). You can afford what a regular person can reasonably afford, unless you have:

<Power power={gold} sample />

### Custom Powers
You can make up your own talents, abilities, and items. Discuss your ideas with the GM before the game to make sure that they approve. 


<!-- Use the lists of premade ones for inspiration, adapt ideas from games, books, or movies. Have fun being creative and coming up with new awesome and unique powers! -->





 

<div className="column-break"/>


### Vitality Tokens (VT)

Vitality tokens represent the amount of health and energy you have. 

<div style="margin-top: 10px;"><img src="./rules-players/vitality-tokens.png" /></div>

Spend 1VT to use a Talent or an Ability.

When something hurts you, you lose 3VT. If you run out of vitality - you pass out, leaving you at the mercy of your enemies.

You can have at most 12VT. You start with 12VT, you restore back to full after you rest between adventures.

### Recovering VT
You gain 3VT when acting according to one of your personality traits puts you at risk/disadvantage or introduces a complication that makes the story more dramatic and exciting. 

> For example: Protecting someone puts your life at risk, following your ideals makes you act against your best interests, your flaw or weakness makes you vulnerable,  indulging in your temptations gets you into trouble, you succumb to your fear at the worst possible moment, your eccentric behavior draws unwanted attention.


### Character Creation

To create your character you need to fill in your <Link to="/character-sheet">character sheet</Link>. 

Make up a name, appearance, and personality for your character. 

Pick **4 Talents**, **4 Abilities**, and **4 Items**.

And you're ready to play!

### Character Advancement
At the end of every session you gain one new **talent**, or **two new abilities**.

You can find new items on your adventures, or receive them as payment for completing quests.

</div>


<!-- 
### Coming up with a character idea

If you’re not sure what kind of character to create - use your favorite character from a book or a movie. If you want to make it more original - combine the traits from several characters (Legolas with the personality of Spider Man, John Snow with the personality of Jack Sparrow), or reverse their gender or a key personality trait (female Tony Stark, evil Hermione, cheerful Batman). If you're still feeling stuck - just play as yourself but with magic powers.

## Rolling Dice

When you attempt a task that is difficult or risky, the GM can tell you to roll a 20-sided die. If your roll is equal to or higher than the target number (set by the GM depending on the difficulty of the task) - you succeed, otherwise you suffer a negative consequence, setback, or a complication.


If you roll a **20** - you succeed in an exceptionally spectacular way, the outcome is extremely favourable to you. If you roll a **1** - you fail and suffer a severe setback.

On a failed roll, you can reroll the dice at a cost. Tell the GM what cost your character will pay for another chance at success, for example: expose yourself to danger, introduce a new problem, break or lose your equipment, lose time, attract unwanted attention, cause collateral damage, offend an ally, give the enemy an opportunity to advance, try a riskier approach that raises the stakes and could lead to a terrible failure, etc.

You can improve your chances by rolling with **advantage**. That means you roll multiple dice, and take the best result. You roll with advantage when you **use a talent relevant to the task you’re attempting**. If you want to use multiple relevant talents - roll an extra die for each one, up to the maximum of 4.

To roll the dice on our discord server, type following commands in the chat:
- `!roll` - roll a single die.
- `!adv2` - roll two dice with advantage.
- `!adv3` - roll three dice with advantage.
- `!adv4` - roll four dice with advantage.

<!-- 
## Combat
During the combat scenes, players take turns describing what they do. Describe how you want to fight, roll the dice, GM will narrate what happens as a result. 

If you fail a roll during combat, you take damage and lose 3VT.
 -->
<!-- GM will tell you how many VT you lose, depending on how powerful the enemy attack was. -->
