# Rules for Players

<div className="columns">

### Stats and Powers
Your character has 3 stats - **Health**, **Energy**, and **Experience**. You also have 4 kinds of "powers" - **Abilities**, **Spells**, **Magic Items**, and **Equipment**. Your character grows stronger when you increase the stats and gain new powers.

### Health Points (HP)
You lose Health Points when you get hurt. Recover points by drinking a potion, using a spell, or taking a rest.
- **Short rest** (1 hour in a safe environment) recovers 5 points.
- **Long rest** (8 hours in a safe environment) restores you to full health.

### Energy Points (EP)
Spend them to cast spells and use abilities.

Recover them by drinking a potion or taking a rest (same as health).

### Experience (XP)
Spend Experience Points to learn Spells and Abilities.

Spend 2 points to increase your max Health or Energy by 1 point.

Gain XP as a reward for overcoming challenges, completing quests, teamwork, and awesome roleplay moments.

### Indulging
You can also recover Energy Points when you indulge in your character's flaw or succumb to their weakness in a way that makes you vulnerable, introduces a complication, sacrifices your relationships, or otherwise puts you at a risk/disadvantage. For example: get angry, act reckless, get caught lying, forget something important, surrender, run away, act lazy, get high at the worst possible moment, trigger the memory of a past trauma, antagonize an NPC, threaten someone too powerful, etc. Depending on the severity of the complication it causes, GM will award you  1-10 EP.

### Inventory
You can carry and use up to 10 Items. Mundane and tiny items don’t count (a note, a pen, regular clothes). Ammo doesn’t count.

During the short rest, you can unequip items and stash them somewhere (at your house, on a horse, etc). Stashed items can’t be used until re-equipped.

### Trading
There’s no gold. There’s no need to micromanage paying for meals, a simple room in an inn, or buying mundane items (arrows, ink) - they cost nothing. For the powerful and valuable items, you trade.

You can trade items in your inventory with friendly NPCs and other players. Items don’t have a predetermined price. It all depends on how much the NPC likes you, and how much they want what you have to offer in exchange. Negotiate and bargain to get a better deal.


<div className="column-break"/>

### Abilities
You use abilities to do things that are difficult or require expertise. For example, lifting heavy things, picking locks, sneaking, climbing, investigating, seducing, lying. Without the relevant ability, your character is as good at doing things as an average person.

There's no dice. You can assume that you will succeed if you try to do something that any regular person is capable of. But if you want to attempt doing something really difficult or risky, the GM can say that it would require a relevant ability (you would need an “Athletics” ability to lift a super heavy rock, “Diplomacy” to talk the king out of starting a war).

Abilities can enable you to use certain items (for example throwing daggers), learn spells from specific Magic Schools (like Necromancy), and unlock other abilities (you need "Intermediate Swordsman" ability to learn "Dual Wielding"). Example of an ability:

<!-- , or add some perks (like being able to carry more equipment). -->
<!-- , and add bonus dice to your rolls (see the dice rolling rules below). -->



<Power power={exampleAbility} sample />

This ability takes **2** Energy Points to cast. It costs **3** experience points to learn, and requires the "Knowledge of Nature" ability.

<!-- This ability takes **2** Energy Points to cast and adds **1** bonus dice to your roll. To learn it, you need **3** experience points, and the "Knowledge of Nature" ability. -->



### Spells
Spells are organized in Magic Schools. To learn more powerful spells you need deeper knowledge of a magic school. For example, you need an "Advanced Telekinesis" ability to cast a "Fly" spell.

Example of a spell:

<Power power={exampleSpell} sample />

This spell costs **2** Energy Points to cast, **3** Experience Points to learn, and requires "Novice Illusionism" ability.

### Magic Items and Equipment
Using items works much like using spells and abilities does. Using equipment usually costs no energy points, but often requires a specialized ability. Example:



<Power power={exampleItem} sample />


### Combat
In combat, the GM will tell you when it's your turn to act. During your turn, your character can move around and do one thing (for example, cast a spell). If you have something that can help you evade the damage (a shield, a spell, a  dodge skill), you can use it when you're attacked. 

If you run out of Health, you pass out. If someone hits you when you’re passed out - you die and turn into a ghost. You can haunt your fellow players until they find a resurrection scroll, or make a new character.

## Creating your Character

To create your character you will need to fill in your <Link to="/character-sheet">character sheet</Link>. It will contain your character’s stats, abilities, spells, inventory, and the description of your character - everything you need for roleplaying.

### Using a premade character sheet (for novice players)
Novice players are highly encouraged to use one of the premade character sheets. Hover over the "Create" button and pick a premade character sheet you think will fit you best. Then all you need is to come up with your character idea (name, appearance, personality, etc), and fill in your character description.

If you’re not sure what kind of character to create - use your favorite character from a book or a movie. If you want to make it more original - combine the traits from several characters (Legolas with the personality of Spider Man, John Snow with the personality of Jack Sparrow), or reverse their gender or a key personality trait (female Tony Stark, evil Hermione, cheerful Batman). If you're still feeling stuck - just play as yourself but with magic powers.

### Custom Character Creation
Players more familiar with their favorite spells and items can create a custom character.

You start with 10 Max Health, 10 Max Energy, and 10 Experience.

Create a blank character sheet and:

- Spend your Experience to learn Abilities and Spells.
- Select up to 2 common magic items.
- Select up to 2 common equipment items.

Then fill in appearance/presonality/ambitions/backstory, and you're ready to play.
