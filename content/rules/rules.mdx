# Rules for Players

<div className="columns">

### Health
Your initial max health is 10 hit-points. You lose points when you get hurt. Recover points by drinking a potion, using a spell, or taking a rest.

**Short rest** (1 hour in a safe environment) recovers 4 points.

**Long rest** (8 hours in a safe environment) restores you to full health.

### Energy Points (EP)
Your initial max energy is 5 points. Spend them to cast spells, use abilities or items.

To cast a spell (or use an ability), spend the amount of points equal to it's level (casting a 3rd Level Spell costs 3 Energy points).

Recover them by drinking a potion or taking a rest (same as health).

You can also recover them when you indulge in your character's flaw or succumb to their weakness in a way that makes you vulnerable, introduces a complication, sacrifices your relationships, or otherwise puts you at a risk/disadvantage. For example: get angry, act reckless, get caught lying, forget something important, surrender, run away, act lazy, get high at the worst possible moment, trigger the memory of a past trauma, antagonize an NPC, threaten someone too powerful, etc. Depending on the severity of the complication it causes, GM will award you  1-10 EP.


### Experience (XP)
Spend points to learn spells and abilities. To learn a spell or an ability, spend the amount of points equal to it's level (learning a 3rd Level Ability costs 3 Experience points).

Spend 2 points to increase your max Health or Energy by 1 point.

Gain XP as a reward for overcoming challenges, completing quests, and awesome roleplay moments.

### Levels (LVL)

Characters start at level 1 (novice) and can grow up to level 10 (godlike). Characters level up when they complete major quests.

Your character can learn spells/abilities according to their level (3rd level character can learn 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level spells).


<div class="column-break"></div>

### Abilities
Extraordinary abilities or specific skills your character has. For example, being very strong, knowing how to pick locks, or being great at seduction.


Without the ability, your character is as good at doing things as an average person. You can assume that you will succeed if you try to do something that any regular person is capable of. But if you want to attempt doing something really difficult or risky, the GM can say that it would require a relevant ability (you would need a   “Strongman” ability to lift a super heavy rock, “a Diplomat” to talk the king out of starting a war).

### Inventory
You can carry and use up to 10 Items. Mundane and tiny items don’t count (a note, a pen, regular clothes). Ammo doesn’t count.

During the short rest, you can unequip items and stash them somewhere (at your house, on a horse, etc). Stashed items can’t be used until re-equipped.


### Trading
There’s no gold. There’s no need to micromanage paying for meals, a simple room in an inn, or buying mundane items (arrows, ink).


You can trade items in your inventory with friendly NPCs and other players. Items don’t have a predetermined price. It all depends on how much the NPC likes you, and how much they want what you have to offer in exchange. Negotiate and bargain to get a better deal.

Give a valuable item to an NPC in exchange for teaching you a skill. Or offer to do some work for them.

### Combat
During the combat, players take turns to act. When all the players have taken their turn, the GM gets a round of turns for all the NPCs they control. 

During your turn, your character can move around and do one thing (for example, cast a spell). If you have a shield spell, or a dodge skill, or something else that can help you evade the damage, you can cast it when you're attacked. 


After the combat, each player can take 1 random item that belonged to an enemy.

If you run out of Health, you pass out. If someone hits you when you’re passed out, you die and turn into a ghost. You can haunt your fellow players until they find a resurrection scroll, or make a new character.

## Creating your Character

To create your character you will need a character sheet and a character description. Character sheet will contain your character’s stats, abilities, spells, and inventory. Character description will contain information on your character’s appearance, personality, goals, and backstory - everything you need for roleplaying.

Novice players are highly encouraged to use one of the premade character sheets. Players more familiar with their favorite spells and items can create a custom character by filling in an empty character sheet.

Next, come up with your character concept and fill in your character description. Even the novice players are encouraged to come up with their own character ideas, but if you’re really stuck or just can’t wait to start playing - you can use one of the premade character descriptions.

# Rules for the GM

<div className="columns">

### Combat
There are 3 distances. If the monster is **In Reach** of the player, that means they can hit it with a melee weapon. If the monster is **In Range**, then the player can hit it with a ranged weapon or a spell, or run up to it during their turn. If the enemy is **Too Far** then the player needs to move closer.

To prepare an enemy encounter, pick which spells the enemy will be able to cast, which items they carry, and how much Health and Energy they have. Or just use one of the premade NPCs.

After the combat, give each player one of the items the defeated enemies had on them (randomly).


### Friendly NPCs
Decide which items the NPC has in their inventory, in case the players will want to trade with them. Think about what kind of abilities they could teach the players. If they have a quest to give, decide on the quest reward.

### Enemy NPCs
Small monsters have 6HP, 6EP, deal 2DMG per attack. Big ones have 10HP, 10EP, deal 4DMG. Tweak as needed. For people - use premade character sheets, or create your own. Decide on HP, EP, and pick Abilities, Spells, Magic Items, and Weapons for them.

### Awarding Experience
Award experience points to the players for completing quests, overcoming difficult challenges, out-of-the-box thinking, great roleplaying moments, and finding clever non-combat resolutions.

After the players complete a quest or overcome a big challenge, ask players to vote on their favorite character moment, idea, or a joke, and grant the author of the best one an extra experience point.

### Leveling Up
When your party completes a major challenge or a big part of a quest, tell them they level up. All characters in the party level up at the same time.

Use leveling up and awarding experience points to control how powerful the party is. Do it slower for longer campaigns, and faster if you want characters to gain powers quicker.

### One-shots

When running a one-shot game, invite characters within the appropriate range of levels to keep the party balanced.

Characters maintain their levels between separate one-shot games. A player can play with some other GM, level up, and join your game as a higher level character.

### Deciding if the player succeeds at an action
Use your own judgment and common sense to decide whether the player's action is successful. If you were reading a novel, and this character had tried to do what the player wants to attempt, would you believe that they succeed?

Follow the rule of cool. The more awesome, creative, or funny the player’s idea is, the more likely it is to work.

Don’t be afraid to add difficulties. When it serves the story, adding tension, drama, and challenges is good. Instead of telling the player that they fail, consider adding drawbacks or unintended negative consequences (“You have successfully killed the guard, but someone has seen it and is now running to raise the alarm.”)

If you’re still unsure whether or not the player should succeed at what they’re trying to do, use this formula:

1. Mentally rank the player’s idea from 1 to 5 (from stupid to brilliant), rank their roleplaying from 1 to 5 (from poor to excellent), add these numbers together. Append 5 to the result if the player has a relevant ability.
2. Mentally rank the difficulty of the challenge the player is facing from 1 to 10.
3. If the first number is higher, the player succeeds, otherwise they fail.

### Rule Zero
All these rules are only a guideline, they exist to help you have fun and tell a cool story. If a rule stands in the way of playing the game you enjoy - ignore it or change it. You are free to override any of the rules, to simplify or extend this system.

If there’s any confusion about the rules - don’t waste time arguing about them or looking things up. Make the decision that makes the most sense to you and go with it
