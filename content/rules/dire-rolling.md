## Rolling Dice (For Players)

When you attempt to do something difficult or risky, the GM will tell you to roll the dice (d20). The number you roll will determine the result of your action:

- **20** - **Triumph**  
You succeed in an exceptionally spectacular way.  
If youâ€™re dealing damage, double it.
- **15-19** - **Success**  
You successfully perform the action you were attempting.
- **7-14** - **Success at a cost**  
You succeed, but suffer some negative consequence, complication, or a setback.
- **2-6** - **Failure**  
You fail, and suffer some negative consequence, complication, or a setback.
- **1** - **Disaster**  
You dramatically fail and suffer a severe setback. You might lose equipment, take damage from an enemy counterattack, or face some other misfortune.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes the GM will tell you to roll several (2, 3, or 4) dice with "**Advantage**" or "**Disadvantage**". If you have Advantage - use the **highest** one of the rolls and ignore the rest. If you have disadvantage - use the **lowest** roll. For example, if GM tells you "Roll 3 Dice with Advantage", and you roll 4,17, and 9, your result is 17.

### You can improve your chances by using abilities
When you have an ability relevant to the task you are attempting, you can use it to add advantage dice to your roll, or remove disadvantage dice.

For example, "Advanced Athletics" ability allows you to add 3 bonus dice to your roll when you're making athletics-related checks (lifting something heavy, breaking through the door, etc.)

- If you were supposed to roll 1 dice, using "Advanced Athletics" allows you to add 3 more dice and roll 4 dice with advantage, greatly increasing your chance of success.
- If you were facing a difficult task and were supposed to roll 3 dice with disadvantage, with "Advanced Athletics" you would roll 2 dice with advantage (remove 2 disadvantage dice and add 1 advantage die).

### Rolling Dice (For GMs)

Tell players to roll the dice only in high stakes, meaningful, dramatic moments when both succeeding and failing at the action could each contribute something interesting to the story. If the roll result doesn't lead to the significant consequences, or if the failure roll doesn't have anything interesting to contribute ("nothing happens") - don't call for a roll, just make the judgement yourself.

In combat, the weapons deal static damage and hit automatically, so rolling dice every turn isn't necessary. Call for a dice roll only when there's a reason the attack would be extra difficult/risky.

Tell players to roll with advantage when they have a particularly creative idea, excellent roleplaying, or created a good in-game reason to maximize their chances. For extra difficult tasks, tell them to roll with disadvantage.

To modify difficulty, tell them to roll multiple dice (2, 3, or 4). For example, for extremely difficult tasks tell them to roll 4 dice with disadvantage. For extremely easy tasks, tell them to roll 4 dice with advantage.

Just to give you some intuition on how this modifies the likelihood of player's success, here are the chances of rolling "Complete Success" or higher, and "Success at a Cost" or higher:

|                          | Complete Success | Success at a Cost |
|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 4 Dice with Advantage    | 76%              | 99%               |
| 3 Dice with Advantage    | 66%              | 97%               |
| 2 Dice with Advantage    | 51%              | 91%               |
| 1 Dice (Flat Roll)       | 30%              | 70%               |
| 2 Dice with Disadvantage | 9%               | 49%               |
| 3 Dice with Disadvantage | 3%               | 34%               |
| 4 Dice with Disadvantage | 1%               | 24%               |
