# Dice Rolling Rules

Mirage can be played either with or without the dice, depending on your preference.

In the diceless version, the GM simply uses their judgement to decide the outcomes of the player's actions. But if you want, you can use the simple dice rolling rules to add randomness and unpredictable outcomes to your game.

To play with the dice, you will need four 20-sided dice for each player (but you can get by with the four dice for the whole group). If you're playing over discord - you can use Avrae bot to roll the dice for you automatically (instructions below).

## Rolling Dice (For Players)

When you attempt to do something difficult or risky, the GM will tell you to roll one or more 20-sided dice (also called **d20**). The number you roll will determine the result of your action:

- **20** - **Triumph**  
You succeed in an exceptionally spectacular way.  
If youâ€™re dealing damage, double it.
- **15-19** - **Success**  
You successfully perform the action you were attempting.
- **7-14** - **Success at a cost**  
You succeed, but suffer some negative consequence, complication, or a setback.
- **2-6** - **Failure**  
You fail, and suffer some negative consequence, complication, or a setback.
- **1** - **Disaster**  
You dramatically fail and things get worse. You might suffer a severe setback, lose equipment, take damage from an enemy counterattack, or face some other misfortune.

An easy way to remember this:

- If you roll **7 or higher** - you succeed at an action, otherwise you fail.
- If you roll **14 or lower** - your action also leads to some negative consequence, complication, or a setback.


### Advantage and Disadvantage
Depending on the difficulty of the task, the GM can tell you to roll several (2, 3, or 4) dice with "**Advantage**" or "**Disadvantage**". You will have Advantage when the task is relatively easy, likely to succeed, or when you came up with a clever/creative approach to solving it.  You will have Disadvantage on partiularly difficult tasks. The harder the task - the more Disadvantage you'll have.

<br/>

- If you have **Advantage** - use the **highest** one of the rolls and ignore the rest.
- If you have **Disadvantage** - use the **lowest** one of the rolls and ignore the rest.

For example, if GM tells you "Roll 3 Dice with Advantage", and you roll **4**, **17**, and **9**, your result is **17**. If GM tells you "Roll 2 Dice with Disadvantage" and you roll **5** and **16**, your result is **5**.



### Bonus Dice

Bonus dice allow you to improve your chances - to add advantage dice or remove disadvantage dice. There are 3 ways to gain bonus dice:


- You gain 1 bonus die if you use an ability, spell, or an item relevant to the task you are attempting.
- You gain 1 bonus die if you creatively use the world around you, find some clever way to approach the task to maximize your chances, or use teamwork to accomplish the task together with other players (describe how you're helping each other out).
- You gain 1 bonus die for excellent roleplaying. Act out a dramatic moment, make a speech, describe what you do in an exceptionally vivid and awesome way,

### Rolling Dice on Discord

Our [discord server](https://discord.gg/zt4N23d) has a list of commands you can use to roll the dice automatically. To add these commands to your own server, use <Link to="/avrae-setup">this guide</Link>.

Type the command in the chat to make a roll:

- `!rl` - roll 1 die (Flat Roll).
- `!adv2` - roll 2 dice with Advantage.
- `!adv3` - roll 3 dice with Advantage.
- `!adv4` - roll 4 dice with Advantage.
- `!dis2` - roll 2 dice with Disadvantage.
- `!dis3` - roll 3 dice with Disadvantage.
- `!dis4` - roll 4 dice with Disadvantage.

## Rolling Dice (For GMs)

Tell players to roll the dice only in high stakes, meaningful, dramatic moments when both succeeding and failing at the action could each contribute something interesting to the story. If the roll result doesn't lead to the significant consequences, or if the failure roll doesn't have anything interesting to contribute ("nothing happens") - don't call for a roll, just make the judgement yourself.

To modify difficulty, tell the player to roll multiple dice (2, 3, or 4). For example, for extremely difficult tasks tell them to roll 4 dice with disadvantage. For extremely easy tasks, tell them to roll 4 dice with advantage.

In combat, the weapons deal static damage and hit automatically, so rolling dice every turn isn't necessary. Call for a dice roll only when there's a reason the attack would be extra difficult/risky, or when it's interesting to have an unpredictable outcome.


To give you some intuition on how advantage and disadvantage modify the likelihood of player's success, here are the chances of rolling "Complete Success" or higher, and "Success at a Cost" or higher:

|                          | Complete Success | Success at a Cost |
|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 4 Dice with Advantage    | 76%              | 99%               |
| 3 Dice with Advantage    | 66%              | 97%               |
| 2 Dice with Advantage    | 51%              | 91%               |
| 1 Dice (Flat Roll)       | 30%              | 70%               |
| 2 Dice with Disadvantage | 9%               | 49%               |
| 3 Dice with Disadvantage | 3%               | 34%               |
| 4 Dice with Disadvantage | 1%               | 24%               |
