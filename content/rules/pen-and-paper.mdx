# Pen and Paper

All you need to play the pen-and-paper version of Mirage is:

1. **Printed out character sheets**  
Print out the [blank sheet]() to fill it in manually, or create the sheet using the <Link to="/character-sheet">character sheet app</Link>, and press `Ctrl+P` to print it.
2. **A bunch of 20-sided dice**  
Ideally, 4 per player, but you can get by with just 5 dice for the whole group.

Use the  <Link to="/all-powers">All Powers</Link> app to look up the abilities, spells, and items.

If you're a GM - use the [blank NPC character sheet]() to create NPCs.

The rest is pretty much the same.

<!-- Premade sheets for each class. -->
