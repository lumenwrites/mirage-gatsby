If you’re still unsure whether or not the player should succeed at what they’re trying to do, use this formula:

1. Mentally rank the player’s idea from 1 to 5 (from stupid to brilliant), rank their roleplaying from 1 to 5 (from poor to excellent), add these numbers together. Append 5 to the result if the player has a relevant ability.
2. Mentally rank the difficulty of the challenge the player is facing from 1 to 10.
3. If the first number is higher, the player succeeds, otherwise they fail.

### Indulging
You can also recover Energy Points when you indulge in your character's flaw or succumb to their weakness in a way that makes you vulnerable, introduces a complication, sacrifices your relationships, or otherwise puts you at a risk/disadvantage. For example: get angry, act reckless, get caught lying, forget something important, surrender, run away, act lazy, get high at the worst possible moment, trigger the memory of a past trauma, antagonize an NPC, threaten someone too powerful, etc. Depending on the severity of the complication it causes, GM will award you  1-10 EP.
