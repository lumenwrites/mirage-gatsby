# Heroes'/Antagonist's Goals
<span className="small">(see more prompts in <Link to="/prompts">Prompts App</Link>)</span>

Stories are fundamentally about problem solving. The problems usually come from the mix of two sources:

1. The Heroes strive to achieve a goal, and struggle to overcome challenges and obstacles on their path (often created by the Villain).
2. Villain wants something, and players are trying to disrupt their evil plan.

Whatever goal the Heroes have - the Villain will have the opposite one (and vice versa). You can start from the either side. Give the goal to the Players ("Obtain a valuable item"), and the Villain will want the opposite ("Obtain the item first"). Give the goal to the Villain ("Perform an Evil Ritual") and the players will want the opposite ("Stop the Evil Ritual"). The only difference is the motivation, Heroes want things for noble reasons, Villains want them for evil ones. If you'll be using the goal for the villain - just put an evil spin on it.

List of goals you can use for either Heroes or Villains:

**Obtain McGuffin/Information.**

## Creating multiple adventures from the same goal
Here's the list of ways to create dozens of unique adventure ideas based on the same goal:

**Switch players/antagonist sides.**

> Players try to get away with a crime instead of investigating it.

**Reverse the goal.**

> Smuggle/Plant an item instead of stealing it.  
> Close the portal instead of opening it.  
> Banish the creature instead of summoning it.  

**Use a different target - person, creature, item, information, location/base.**

> Destroy an item instead of killing a person.  
> Abduct a person instead of stealing the treasure.  
> Protect a secret instead of the location.  
> Chase a lost pet instead of the criminal.  

**Change "do it for yourself" to "help other people".**

> Don't get murdered - prevent a murder.  
> Steal an item - create a distraction while someone else steals it.  
> Get away with the crime - help someone else to get away with the crime.

**Add restrictions/complications.**

> Make it stealthy (commit a heist instead of robbery).  
> Avoid violence (capture a person alive instead of killing them).  
> Achieve the goal by social means (ruin the person's reputation instead of killing them).  
> Do it before the rivals do it first.  
> See the [list of complications](https://playmirage.io/prompts/complications) for more ideas.

**Combine multiple goals.**

> Deliver an item while on the run from the law.  
> Sabotage a ritual to rescue a person.  
> Infiltrate a group to steal an item.  
> Solve a mystery to be able to find a lost person.

**Add different subgoals, put different challenges/obstacles in the way.**

> Get through the dangerous location instead of an elaborate security system.  
> Obtain information about the villain's weakness instead of the only weapon that can kill them.  
> Convince a witness to talk instead of following the trail of footsteps.  
> The object is difficult to deliver because it's being hunted by bandits, or because the terrain is dangerous and inhospitable, or because it's large and fragile, or because it's a criminal trying to escape, or because it's cattle you need to keep alive, or because it's a bratty princess who doesn't want to go to school.  
> See the [List of Challenges](https://playmirage.io/prompts/challenges) and [List of Villain's Moves](https://playmirage.io/prompts/villain-moves) for more ideas.

**Use different concrete details - High Concept Premise, Settings, NPCs, McGuffins, etc.**

> Steal the Elixir of Youth from the unicorn instead of stealing the Aztec gold from the Spanish Galleon.   
> Steal an item from a dream instead of casino.  
> Escort a dragon instead of a prisoner.  
> Escape from Jurassic Park instead of the prison.  
> Fight a self righteous paladin instead of the bandit gang leader.   


**Use different motivations.**

> Kill a person out of revenge instead of for money.  
> Resurrect your loved one instead of summoning a demon.  
> Compete for the heart of the lady instead of the treasure.
