** Session Announcement
Hey, @everyone! Who's up for a brainstorming session at 9AM CST (1.5 hours from now)?

I'm looking for 2-4 people. If you can join us - leave a message in this chat.
We'll try to make a short, lighthearted, low-combat, system-agnostic, fantasy one-shot adventure.
It usually takes around 2 hours, give or take.

** Pre-session post
@everyone We begin in 10 minutes and we have some spots open. If you're free - come join us!

This is the google doc we'll be filling in with ideas, open it before we begin:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vgd4MJkk-WVwRXmmnbgHd518CWa05Ka59NSq_hems-I/
In the google doc go to Tools > Preferences, and uncheck "Automatically Detect Lists", otherwise google docs autoformatting will be really annoying.
Feel free to start filling in the first section with the ideas before we begin the session.

If you haven't read the guidelines yet - check them out:

I also recommend to open a note-taking app, can be convenient. And you can open the writing prompts generator (https://playmirage.io/prompts), if you feel like it'll be useful to you.

** Zoom Game Announcement
[Online] [Other] A novice GM looking for some friendly people to join my actual play one-shot (zoom video chat uploaded to youtube, very simple, no special requirements for equipment or skill, all you need is a webcam)

Hi everyone! Novice GM here. I have recently started experimenting with recording my games and uploading them to youtube - so we aren't just playing, but also creating something cool. I'm looking for some nice people who want to participate in this little project.

There are no specific requirements for your improv skill or equipment, all you need is a webcam. We're not trying to be the Critical Role or Dimension 20, it is just a simple low-production-value low-expectations experiment. We'll roll the dice in the discord text chat, talk over zoom video chat, and after the game I'll edit the video a bit and upload it to youtube (if it turns out well). If you haven't used zoom yet - it's super easy to set up, about 5 minutes. You can take a look at one of our previous games [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Cn9vV_wHpY4).

Novice players are welcome! We'll start simple, and get better as we go along. I'm hoping to find some friendly people who are interested in learning and growing together. If you want to experiment with this sort of thing, learn how it's done, and can be patient if things go wrong - you're welcome to join the game!

The system we'll be playing is called [Mirage](https://playmirage.io) - a lighthearted, low-combat, rules-light, storytelling/improv-focused roleplaying game. It's like DnD, but focused on social/creative aspects, without all the math, intricate rules, and the slow combat encounters. 

It's very simple, it takes 10-20 minutes to understand the rules and prepare for the game, it'll be perfect for a youtube show. All you need to start playing is the basic understanding of the [rules](https://playmirage.io/rules), and a [character sheet](https://playmirage.io/character-sheet) (you can use a premade one, or I can help you make a new one). If you're unfamiliar with the system - don't worry, I'll help you out, just let me know if you have any questions or need any help with the rules or character creation.

I need 3 players, we'll play a short and simple lighthearted one-shot, should be about 2-3 hours long. We'll start playing in about 2-3 hours, once the players are ready.

If that sounds interesting - send me a message(`lumen#7925` on Discord).

We'll try to make a short, lighthearted, low-combat, system-agnostic, fantasy one-shot adventure taking place in the Academy of Arcane Arts and Adventures (basically Hogwarts, but itâ€™s a college, and it's for every kind of adventurer, not just wizards).
